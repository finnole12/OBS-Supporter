# OBS-Supporter by finnole12

this app starts up and configures obs automatically for selected games
this is using the obs-websocket plugin for obs and the obs-websocket-dotnet api both from https://github.com/Palakis.

INSTALL GUIDE:

0. install obs
  1. install the obs-websocket plugin https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket
  2. launch my app from anywhere and browse for your obs64.exe in the obs install directory.
  
 USE GUIDE:
  1. once installed click "open and connect" to startup obs.
  2. go to the "scene configuration" tab and add as many scene configurations as you need.
  3. pick the scene and add the executables that you want to record with the selected scene.
 
 For the moment the only recording-mode supported is the replay-buffer.
